## Setup and Run
You will need **python3** installed. We will explicitly use the **python3** command below but, of course, if your environment is configured to use python3 by default, you do not need to. We have also only tested this on **Ubuntu 18**. It most likely works on all recent versions of Ubuntu, but we cannot guarantee it will work in other environments.
